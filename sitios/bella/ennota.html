    <p>Informal neighborhood bankers take advantage of low-income immigrants without access to credit. They say they want to “help.” The story is complex. Intimidation and debt. The American dream in 36 installments and a 30 percent interest rate.</p>

<p>Propped open on her lap, Maria Ramos, a 64-year-old small-business owner from Washington Heights, New York, holds a large, faded ledger that shows the difficulties she faces to keep her beauty salon afloat.</p>

<!-- ESTE ES EL ICONO DE BILLETE  **  -->

</div>

<p>The ledger was a gift  from a beauty products supplier, an oversized agenda for 2014.  Over time it has become a repository of balance sheets.  The debts accrued with neighborhood lenders are recorded inside, and the final tally never seems to go down, despite her weekly payments.</p>

<p>At the moment, Ramos is paying down three loans, totaling $14,000. Ramos took money from Barbie, Rafael and Maria José - three lenders who charge a weekly interest of 4%, despite the fact that they are operating under the table. (The names of the lenders have been changed at the request of the source.)</p>

<p>"I can't sleep sometimes. I spend the night thinking about the debt", said Ramos, sitting in one of the worn chairs where she cuts her clients’ hair.</p>

<p>There are no frills in her beauty salon, the accommodations include a wooden bench, a couple of office chairs and five hair dryers, the kind that look like space helmets. In a corner, two tin pots and an electric burner heat the water she uses to wash her clients’ hair.</p>

  <p><a href="envideo.html"><b>Video Explainer:</b> How Community Loans Work and What You Have to Watch Out For.</a></p>

<p>During our conversation she flipped through the pages of her ledger, settling finally on the entry for December 25, where she ran her finger down the long list of names and amounts. Next to the name of the informal bankers who had given her the loans she had scribbled the original debt and how much she has paid so far.</p>

<p>When pressed on the final amount, Ramos hesitates. She’s unsure of the current balance. And then, lowering her voice so her clients in the salon can’t hear, she points quietly to an an entry from mid-april. “This is it”.</p>

<p>It was for $10,800. By 2016, after spending two years paying $2,600 in weekly dues, she had only paid down a third of the debt.</p>

<p>"I tried to reach an arrangement with the lenders", the Dominican hairdresser told us.</p>

<p>They now charge her a rate of 3% per week, cutting back on the principal to lower the monthly fee. In this scenario, it will take her even longer to get out of her financial commitment.</p>

<p>It was by using these same means that Ramos opened her first salon, three years ago.  The lenders from her neighborhood have always financed her business ventures. The only exception came when she applied for a loan from a bank, she was rejected because she did not have a credit history.</p>

<p>"I asked for a $10,000 loan, but what I got was a credit card for $7,000. I spent it all on the salon... And I didn’t keep up with the credit card payments", she said.</p>

<p>Her story shows the role of an unregulated financial market that operates in the underground for many immigrants in low-income neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Informal lenders have given loans to Ramos ranging from $2,000 to $35,000. She has always paid back, she says.</p>

  <div class="cita1">
       <a href=""><img class="svg" src="assets/images/bolsa.svg" alt="bolsa"/></a>
        <p>“I can’t sleep at night <br> thinking about <br> my debt,” said <br> María Ramos.</p>
  </div>


  <p>The Neighborhood Trust Organization - which trains people from low-income backgrounds to participate in the American financial system-- reports that an individual can obtain up to $900,000 in loans.</p>

  <p>There are no official studies on the total value of the community financial market in New York City. However, a survey made 21 years ago by the  <a href="http://www.whidc.org/">Washington Heights and Inwood Development Corporation</a> (WHIDC), found that informal lenders handled about $10 million in loans in only ten blocks in Washington Heights. Adjusted for inflation, that would amount to $18 million.</p>

  <p>WHIDC offers micro-loans to small entrepreneurs and empowers the community on the use of money since 1978. Nine out of ten people who come to this organization are of Latin origin.</p>

    <blockquote class="quote quote-left"><p> <span class="numero">16%</span> or higher interest rate for a loan <br> is illegal in New York</p></blockquote>

  <p>For those without access to traditional banking, lenders are usually the easiest way to access some form of credit.  Many customers fall into a cycle of recurring debt, and do not develop a formal credit history, the traditional gateway to the conventional banking system.</p>

  <p>Dennis Reeder, director of WHIDC, explained that the socio-economic characteristics found in immigrant communities make it difficult to save money and raise a business.</p>

  <p>"I'm talking about small businesses. It would be impossible for them to survive without lenders... Which is why they use them,"said Reeder.</p>

  <p>Lenders have been traditionally associated with loan sharks, and the violence that comes with organized crime. However, people who lend money in neighborhoods also tend to be neighbors, family members and friends of friends.</p>

  <p>Ivelisse García, a 48-year-old Dominican woman, got into the business of lending money three years ago, when she used her tax refund for loans. She also lives off her earnings as a nanny in Manhattan and as the legal guardian of four kids.</p>

  <p>The customers of doña Bella, as she is known, are close friends like Jorge, her hairdresser, and other people in her inner circle. "This business gives me the ability to do things for other people", she said. </p>

  <p>On Saturdays she visits her clients to collect money from their debts. She recognizes that the work can be hard, she is often forced to call back several times before getting paid.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes I have to ready myself emotionally before knocking on the door," she said.</p>

  <p>Before going off to collect, she usually turns on the radio on her car to travel with the rhythm of the music.</p>

  <p>"Look, I'm calling and you are not picking up the phone. I am listening to your voice. Open me the door", she adds, explaining how has faced this type of situation.</p>

  <p><a href="enaudioslide.html">Listen to Doña Bella on her way to collect money.</a></p>

  <p>Doña Bella says that her customers seek her out because they need cash to pay the rent, or for an immigration attorney, holidays, or any other incidental expense. She charges a weekly minimum interest rate of 20%.</p>

  <p>Charging an interest of more than 16% per month is illegal in New York. This is one reason why many lenders operate in secrecy.</p>

  <p>This also why the lenders aren’t open for business with anyone who seeks them out. Trust is one of the pillars of the neighborhood banking code.</p>

  <p>Customers are chosen because they are well-known, or are recommended by people who have the lender’s trust.</p>

  <p>That is the case of the hairdresser Maria Ramos, who has taken loans from seven lenders during her 30 years as an entrepreneur. They have all been Dominicans and Cubans. </p>

  <p>Through the referral of friends she managed to get in touch with informal bankers. The approval of a loan in this system depends on the ability of the customer to pay on time, and also on the quality of the people they recommend. In Ramos’ case, two of her lenders cut her off after some acquaintances she had recommended failed to pay back their loans.</p> 

  <p>"Everything is based on trust and a handshake", said Dennis Reeder, director of WHIDC, who has heard numerous stories of lenders from individuals who have received financial education services from his organization. </p>

  <p>A tour of 116th Street in East Harlem during a Saturday in winter time confirms the role that a sense of trust plays in this market. </p>

   <div class="cita1">
     <a href=""> <img class="svg" src="assets/images/bolsa.svg" alt="bolsa"/> </a><p>“Everything is based on <br> trust and a <br> handshake,” said Dennis <br> Reeder from WHIDC.</p>
   </div>


   <p>Do you know where can I find a lender?, we asked a street vendor who was bundled up to mitigate the cold. </p>

  <p>The question invariably raised silence, or a nervous laugh. </p>

  <p>"I know there are some but I don’t know where they are... they are not going to lend you money because they don’t know you" responds the man with a Caribbean accent who sells cleaning products. </p>

  <p>Walking along 116th Street in East Harlem is like making a journey through a working class neighborhood in Latin America. Retailers use music and flyers to lure in customers. The need for a quick infusion of cash can be detected in the proliferation of pawn shops that overlook the housing projects. </p>

  <p>A report of <a href="http://www.usfinancialdiaries.org/issue3-informal"> U.S. Financial Diaries </a>(USFD) explains that traditional banking institutions have not been able to replicate the characteristics of informal lenders, or considered how this segment of clients make financial decisions. </p>

  <p>In order to open a bank account an individual needs to fill out a series of papers and forms. Different forms of ID are required. These are major stumbling blocks for many in immigrant communities.</p>

  <p>The USFD report confirms that loans between family and friends are the second most common choice of credit in this country. </p>

  <p>"Many of them (immigrants) come from countries where their money is safer under the mattress than in a Bank," Reeder explained. </p>

  <p>This is the case of María Mendoza, a 56-year-old resident of the Bronx. She has a savings account, but has never applied for a bank loan. </p>

  <p>Instead, she has been a customer of several neighborhood lenders for over 15 years. She deposits the money from these loans in her savings account. </p>
  
  <p>"My mom is in Puerto Rico, and I save money for an emergency," says Mendoza, who specifies that her daughter works in a bank and manages her account. </p>

  <p>She has saved $5,000. "Yes it is worth going to the lender. I think that they have lower interests rates than the bank ,"she added.</p>

  <!--  <div class="subtitulo"> La estrategia de la intimidación </div> -->


    <p>One of the dark sides of the lenders is that they ignore the financial capacity of their customers. That generates a level of indebtedness that becomes unmanageable, especially for clients that take on more than one loan. </p>

<p>Maria Ramos, the entrepreneur who has always supported herself through informal banking, had paid about $2,600 to her three lenders in April. One-sixth of that amount ($486) corresponds to interests. </p>

<p>"The interests of informal loans are out of control. Payment periods are aggressive. There are cases of customers who pay 300% interest only because they are set in an arbitrary manner ", said Eric Espinoza, from the Advisory Neighborhood Trust organization." </p>

<p>In a conventional bank such as Citibank, Ramos would pay a monthly fee of $350 for a loan ranging between $10,000 and $14,000, depending on the customer’s credit history, a record that is compiled from the individual’s track record on past payments, outstanding debts, and types of credit used in the past. </p>

<p>When an individual does not appear in the database of credit bureaus - which keep the information of banks - they miss opportunities to buy a car, a house or to ask for a loan to start a business. </p>

<p>A population of 45 million people (equivalent to the total population of Colombia) had no credit history in the United States in 2015. </p>

<p>The studies of the <a href="http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201505_cfpb_data-point-credit-invisibles.pdf">Office of Financial Consumer Protection</a> show that 15% of the people in this group are Hispanic and African-American, while only 9% is Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>There are other, darker consequences that are a part of this informal market.  Many customers feel the pressure to pay back when they miss a payment. </p>

<p>María Mendoza remembers when, a few years ago, her brother made a deal with a lender.  She had made the recommendation on his behalf. The lender died and her brother decided to abandon the commitment. </p>

<p>A problem arose when the son of the deceased decided to collect the debt. </p>

<p>According to Mendoza, two men knocked on her door some time later. Mendoza opened it. On the other side there were "two older men, tough-looking". They were two collectors sent by the son of the lender, one was short and the other was taller. </p>

<blockquote class="quote quote-left"><p><span class="numero">45</span> million people <br> don’t have <br> a credit score in the U.S.</p></blockquote>

<p>They asked for her brother’s address. She refused to give out the information. </p>

<p>"When I see him around, he’ll see", she says they told her. "well those threats are strong words.", she remembers thinking. </p>

<p>In Washington Heights, Maria Ramos admits to being more committed to pay the weekly fee to her three lenders than pay her credit card debt, because she wants to avoid trouble. </p>

<p>Pointing at the entrance of her beauty salon, she says that when it’s time to collect the lenders "stand here.  They come to get your money and if you don’t have it they start to make a show,"she said. </p>

<p>The way out of the informal banking cycle is by having more knowledge about the U.S. banking system and to build up a credit history with time. </p>

<p>The program of financial education in the city, known as a Financial Empowerment Center, helps people to connect with the formal banking system. </p>

<p>However, the need for fast money and problems to meet the requirements in formal banking continue feeding the lender's market.</p>

<p>Eric Espinoza considered important to create strategies to convey information "word of mouth" on the cases of people who have managed to get out of the debt of lenders. This mechanism would take advantage of the channels of the communities and create confidence. </p>

<p>However, situations such as the ones small business owner Maria Ramos is facing, </p>being forced to continue to have a relationship with lenders despite the risks. </p>

<p>She says she asked for a loan from WHIDC, a organization that promotes financial education, to pay off debts with her three lenders and credit card. 
However, Maria Ramos has other plans. She will invest that money in a new 
beauty salon.  </p>

<p>"If I can put the business where I am thinking about puting it, I will work more... Maybe I will win new customers", she said. </p>

<p>As other members of the Latino community prefers to borrow more. It is a commitment to the future that will do for their businesses. </p>

<p>She says she can’t complain about the neighborhood lenders because they have "turned out life" and while this idea remains in a grey area it will continue to have customers.</p>
